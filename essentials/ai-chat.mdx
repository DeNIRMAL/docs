<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Temporal Context">
    Understands when you saved content and can focus on recent or historical information as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Space Context">
    Can limit responses to specific spaces or combine insights across multiple spaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Type Context">

### Asking Effective Questions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Be Specific"
    icon="target"
  >
    "Find React performance optimization techniques" vs. "Find React stuff"
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Provide Context"
    icon="context"
  >
    "For my current project on e-commerce, what payment processing options did I research?"
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Use Natural Language"
    icon="comment-alt"
  >
    Ask questions as you would to a knowledgeable colleague
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Build on Responses"
    icon="layer-group"
  >

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Conversation Strategies

#### Progressive Refinement
1. Start with a broad question
2. Narrow down based on the response
3. Ask for specific examples or details
4. Request actionable insights

#### Example Flow:
```
You: "What have I learned about productivity?"
AI: [Provides overview of productivity content]

You: "Focus on time management techniques specifically"
AI: [Narrows to time management methods]

You: "Which of these would work best for a developer?"
AI: [Tailors recommendations to development work]

You: "Give me a practical implementation plan"
AI: [Provides actionable steps]
```
