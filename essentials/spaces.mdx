## Working with Content in Spaces

### Adding Content to Spaces

There are several ways to add content to your spaces:

#### 1. During Memory Creation
When adding new memories, you can specify which spaces to include them in:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vevibe.com/v1/add \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "page",
    "content": "https://example.com/article",
    "spaces": ["space-uuid-1", "space-uuid-2"]
  }'
```

#### 2. Moving Existing Content
You can move memories between spaces:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vevibe.com/v1/spaces/moveContent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "spaceId": "target-space-uuid",
    "documentId": "memory-uuid"
  }'
```

#### 3. Browser Extension
When saving content with the browser extension, select the target space from the dropdown.

### Content Organization

SuperMemory automatically helps organize content within spaces:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI-Powered Categorization">
    Our AI analyzes your content and suggests relevant tags and categories, making it easier to find related information later.

    Get suggestions for related content within the same space, helping you discover connections you might have missed.
