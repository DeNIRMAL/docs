## What are Memories?

Memories are the core content units in SuperMemory. Every piece of information you save—whether it's a web page, document, note, or tweet—becomes a memory that's intelligently processed, indexed, and made searchable by our AI system.

## Types of Memories

SuperMemory supports various content types, each optimized for its specific format:

## Memory Lifecycle

Understanding how memories are processed helps you work more effectively with SuperMemory:

### 1. Ingestion
When you add content, SuperMemory immediately:
- Creates a memory record
- Assigns a unique UUID
- Begins content processing

### 2. Processing
Our AI workflow:
- Extracts text from various formats
- Generates metadata (title, description, tags)
- Creates vector embeddings for semantic search
- Extracts key entities and topics

### 3. Indexing
Processed memories are:
- Added to the search index
- Made available for AI chat
- Connected to related content
- Organized within specified spaces

### 4. Enhancement
Over time, memories are enhanced with:
- Usage analytics
- Relationship mapping
- Quality improvements
- Updated metadata

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Content Access">
    Ensure URLs are accessible and content isn't behind paywalls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Processing">
    Use the reprocess endpoint to try again
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual Intervention">
    For persistent issues, manually extract and add content
  </Step>
</Steps>

```bash
# Reprocess memories with missing metadata
curl -X POST https://api.vevibe.com/v1/reprocess-missing-metadata \
